/** MRF24J40 class. Provides a simple send/receive API for a microchip
 ** MFR24J40 IEEE 802.15.4 tranceiver. The tranceiver is available on a 
 ** module that can easilly be soldered to some header pins to use it with
 ** an mbed on a breadboard. The module is called 'MRF24J40MA' and can be 
 ** ordered for example by www.farnell.com.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 * #include "MRF24J40.h"
 * 
 * // RF tranceiver to link with handheld.
 * MRF24J40 mrf(p11, p12, p13, p14, p21);
 * 
 * // LEDs
 * DigitalOut led1(LED1);
 * DigitalOut led2(LED2);
 * DigitalOut led3(LED3);
 * DigitalOut led4(LED4);
 * 
 * // Timer.
 * Timer timer;
 * 
 * // Serial port for showing RX data.
 * Serial pc(USBTX, USBRX); 
 * 
 * // Send / receive buffers.
 * // IMPORTANT: The MRF24J40 is intended as zigbee tranceiver; it tends
 * // to reject data that doesn't have the right header. So the first 
 * // 8 bytes in txBuffer look like a valid header. The remaining 120
 * // bytes can be used for anything you like.
 * uint8_t txBuffer[128]= {1, 8, 0, 0xA1, 0xB2, 0xC3, 0xD4, 0x00};
 * 
 * uint8_t rxBuffer[128];
 * uint8_t rxLen;
 * 
 * int main (void)
 * {
 *     uint8_t count = 0;
 *     pc.baud(115200);
 *     timer.start();
 *     while(1)
 *     {
 *         // Check if any data was received. 
 *         rxLen = mrf.Receive(rxBuffer, 128);
 *         if(rxLen) 
 *         {
 *             // Toggle LED 1 upon each reception of data.
 *             led1 = led1^1;
 *             // Send to serial.
 *             // IMPORTANT: The last two bytes of the received data
 *             // are the checksum used in the transmission. 
 *             for(uint8_t i=0; i<rxLen; i++)
 *             {
 *                 pc.printf("0x%02X ", rxBuffer[i]);
 *             }
 *             pc.printf("\r\n");
 *         }
 *         
 *         // Each second, send some data.
 *         if(timer.read_ms() >= 1000) 
 *         {
 *             timer.reset();
 *             // Toggle LED 2.
 *             led2 = led2^1;
 *             
 *             // UART.
 *             pc.printf("TXD\r\n");
 *
